# Write a program that will automatically send out a notification
# message to a select group of people on your friend list.
# Your program may have to deal with exceptional cases, such as
# friends being offline, the chat window appearing at different
# coordinates on the screen, or confirmation boxes that interrupt
# your messaging. Your program will have to take screen-shots to
# guide its GUI interaction and adopt ways of detecting when its
# virtual keystrokes arenâ€™t being sent.
